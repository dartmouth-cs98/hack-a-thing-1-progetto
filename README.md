## Description
I never built a native iOS app, so I wanted to try building a simple app using Swift and Xcode. Having never worked with Swift or Xcode, it was quite fun to learn something from scratch. For my app, I built a simple emoji app with a simple UI. In this app, you can click on an emoji button, and the app will tell you what that emoji means with a pop up message.

After this simple app, I wanted to experiment with Apple's new ARkit. To this end, I build a simple app that recognizes and maps planar surfaces onto flat objects. These surfaces are then displayed via grey surfaces.

## Learnings
- Learned Swift
- Learned how to build simple UI in Xcode
- Learned how Xcode works
- Learned how to use Apple's ARkit

## What didnt work
I also wanted to add 3d objects in the AR app, but I kept running into issues of non-recognized image asset. There are many file types for 3d objects (szn, sn). I degugged for a long time, and I could not figure out the error.
